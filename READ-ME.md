# Phishing URL Checker

## Overview
The Phishing URL Checker is a Python-based tool designed to help identify potentially malicious URLs. It operates in two modes:
- **CLI Mode**: Command-line interface with color-coded outputs for safe and unsafe links.
- **GUI Mode**: Graphical user interface built with Tkinter for easy interaction.

This tool can also validate URLs anonymously using a headless browser with proxy support, ensuring your IP address is not exposed.

## Features
- Detects phishing indicators in URLs.
- Supports anonymous URL validation via Selenium and a TOR proxy.
- CLI mode with a bright yellow banner and color-coded outputs.
- GUI mode with intuitive input and result display.
- Analyzes URL structure and hosting details.
